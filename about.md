## Kaushalya Madhawa
<!-- ![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }}) -->
I'm from Sri Lanka, living in Tokyo, Japan for the last ten years. I work as a Research Engineer at the AI4Science Team at [SB Intuitions](https://www.sbintuitions.co.jp/en/). With a background in healthcare and drug discovery from my time at the University of Tokyo, Lily MedTech, and Preferred Networks (PFN), I build machine learning models to tackle real-world challenges. I earned my PhD in Computer Science (AI) from the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

Outside of work, I’m a casual runner and a coffee lover walking around Tokyo to find the best cafes. You can track my running progress on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/4369039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strava</a> or check out the [cafes I’ve enjoyed visiting](/tags/#cafe).
