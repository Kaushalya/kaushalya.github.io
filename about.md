Research scientist at [SB Intuitions](https://www.sbintuitions.co.jp/en/), leveraging AI for scientific advancement. With a background in healthcare and drug discovery from my time at the University of Tokyo, Lily MedTech, and Preferred Networks, I build machine learning models to tackle real-world challenges. I earned my PhD in Computer Science (AI) from the Tokyo Institute of Technology.
