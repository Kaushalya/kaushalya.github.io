This repository contains the code for fine-tuning a CLIP model [[Arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020)][[OpenAI Github Repo](https://github.com/openai/CLIP)] on the [ROCO dataset](https://github.com/razorx89/roco-dataset), a dataset made of radiology images and a caption.
This work is done as a part of the [**Flax/Jax community week**](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/research_projects/jax-projects/README.md#quickstart-flax-and-jax-in-transformers) organized by Hugging Face and Google.
